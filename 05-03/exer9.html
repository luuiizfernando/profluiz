        If you ever leave me, baby<br>
        Leave some morphine at my door<br>
        'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication<br>
        To realize what we used to have<br>
        We don't have it anymore<br>
        <br>
        There's no religion that could save me<br>
        No matter how long my knees are on the floor (oh)<br>
        So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'<br>
        To keep you by my side<br>
        To keep you from walkin' out the door<br>
        'Cause there'll be no sunlight<br>
        If I lose you, baby<br>
        There'll be no clear skies<br>
        If I lose you, baby<br>
        <br>
        Just like the clouds<br>
        My eyes will do the same if you walk away<br>
        Everyday it'll rain, rain, ra-a-a-ain<br>
        I'll never be your mother's favorite<br>
        Uh, your daddy can't even look me in the eye<br>
        Ooh, if I was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing<br>
        Sayin', "There goes my little girl<br>
        Walkin' with that troublesome guy"<br>
        <br>
        But they're just afraid of something they can't understand<br>
        Ooh, but little darlin' watch me change their minds<br>
        Yeah for you I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try<br>
        And pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding<br>
        If that'll make you mine<br>
        'Cause there'll be no sunlight<br>
        If I lose you, baby<br>
        There'll be no clear skies<br>
        If I lose you, baby<br>
        Just like the clouds<br>
        <br>
        My eyes will do the same if you walk away<br>
        Everyday it'll rain, rain, ra-a-a-ain<br>
        Oh, don't you say (don't you say) goodbye (goodbye)<br>
        Don't you say (don't you say) goodbye (goodbye)<br>
        I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding<br>
        If that'll make it right<br>
        'Cause there'll be no sunlight<br>
        <br>
        If I lose you, baby<br>
        And there'll be no clear skies<br>
        If I lose you, baby<br>
        And just like the clouds<br>
        My eyes will do the same if you walk away<br>
        Everyday it'll rain, rain, ra-a-a-ain<br>
